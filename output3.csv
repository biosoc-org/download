It consists in a user-friendly Visual Force Field Derivation Toolkit (VFFDT) to derive the force field parameters via simply clicking on the bond or angle in the 3D viewer, and we have further extended our previous program to support the Hessian matrix output from a variety of quantum mechanics (QM) packages, including Gaussian 03/09, ORCA 3.0, QChem, GAMESS-US, and MOPAC 2009/2012. In this toolkit, a universal VFFDT XYZ file format containing the raw Hessian matrix is available for all of the QM packages, and an instant force field parametrization protocol based on a semiempirical quantum mechanics (SQM) method is introduced. The new function that can automatically obtain the relevant parameters for zinc, copper, iron, etc., which can be exported in AMBER Frcmod format, has been added. Furthermore, our VFFDT program can read and write files in AMBER Prepc, AMBER Frcmod, and AMBER Mol2 format and can also be used to customize, view, copy, and paste the force field parameters in the context of the 3D viewer, which provides utilities complementary to ANTECHAMBER, MCPB, and MCPB.py in the AmberTools.Proposed by the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University"

It computes the thermodynamic coupling between functional sites in proteins and then determines the contribution of specific interactions to that coupling. First, a 3-dimensional protein structure (PDB file) is transformed into a Gaussian Network Model. The coupled motions of two sites are then decomposed using Canonical Correlation Analysis. Finally, the statistical mechanics-based thermodynamic coupling function formalism is applied to identify interactions that mediate the thermodynamic coupling between the canonical pairs of motions.
