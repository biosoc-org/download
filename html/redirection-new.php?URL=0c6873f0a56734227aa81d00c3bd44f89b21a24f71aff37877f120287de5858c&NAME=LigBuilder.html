<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of 
structure-based drug design is to find chemical structures fitting in the binding pocket 
of the receptor.</font><big> LigBuilder is a powerful multiple-purposed program written 
for structure-based drug design procedure. Based on the three-dimensional structure of the 
target protein, it can automatically build ligand molecules within the binding pocket and 
subsequently screen them. </big></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In brief, main features of 
LigBuilder include:</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The program analyzes the 
binding pocket of the target protein and derives the key interaction sites. A 
pharmacophore model is suggested and it could be applied to 3D database searching.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) User can choose to develop 
ligand molecules by growing strategy or linking strategy. Both of lead discovery and lead 
optimization tasks can be carried out.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Molecules are built up by 
using fragment as building blocks. Various kinds of structure manipulation are provided, 
such as growing, linking, and mutation. On-the-fly minimization of conformation is 
performed during the building-up procedure. The flexibility of the ligand molecules is 
considered.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Molecules are evolved by 
Genetic Algorithm. The fitness score of a molecule is evaluated by considering its 
chemical viability as well as binding affinity.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Chemical rules for judging 
&quot;drug-likeness&quot; are applied to screen the resultant molecules. Chemical 
stability, synthesis feasibility, and toxicity can also be taken into account by defining 
&quot;forbidden structure&quot; libraries. </big></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) All the input and output 
molecules are in popular format, i.e. protein in PDB format and ligand in Sybyl Mol2 
format. The program is very easy to use and maintain.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
LigBuilder program is freely distributed to the public. The latest version is LigBuilder 
v1.0. You can download it from the FTP server located at the Molecular Design Lab, 
Institute of Physical Chemistry, Peking University (<a href="ftp://ftp2.ipc.pku.edu.cn/">ftp://ftp2.ipc.pku.edu.cn/</a>). 
Please find it under the directory &quot;pub/software/LigBuilder/&quot;.</big></font> </font>
