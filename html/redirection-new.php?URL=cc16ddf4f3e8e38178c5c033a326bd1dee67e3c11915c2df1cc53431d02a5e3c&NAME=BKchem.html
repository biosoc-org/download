    <h2>Welcome to homepage of BKChem - a free chemical drawing program.</h2>

    <p>
      BKChem is a free (as in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
	software</a> :o) chemical drawing program. It was conceived and written by 
      <a href="mailto:beda@zirael.org">Beda Kosata</a> and is currently maintained by 
    <a href="mailto:rei4dan@gmail.com">Reinis Danne</a>.</p> 
    <p>BKChem is written in <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, an interpreted and very nice
      programming language.  This implies some of the program features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>platform independence - BKChem should run on any platform that Python does.*</li>
      <li>performance - as Python is interpreted language you should not expect the performance of a
	native code compiled application (in present days a very cheap tradeoff for platform
      independence). However BKChem should be pretty usable on all modern systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>* BKChem is developed on GNU/Linux. It was however successfully used under WinXP and <a href="fna_en.html#mac_os">MacOS X</a>.</p>

      <li class="news" id="news-46"><b class="news_title">2010-06-25 - BK is dead - long live BKChem</b>:
      <p>Dear BKChem users,<br/><br/> it is already more than 10 years since I started to work on BKChem. It has never occurred to me that it could develop into something useful and interesting for others. Now, after those long years of almost solitary work on BKChem, I think the time has come for me to step down and pass the torch to someone new.</p>
      <p>I will not bother you with my reasons, as I believe they are pretty standard - family, work, no time to spend on hobby projects The result is that I was not able to work on BKChem properly for a year or more. Because of this, I decided to make one last release and announce the death of BKChem. By a lucky coincidence, I was contacted by Reinis Danne, who has shown much interest in working on BKChem, before I actually did this. After a few emails and patches, I offered him to take over the project and he accepted it.</p>
      <p>This means that in the following weeks, more and more of the BKChem development will move to Reinis' hands. As start, my Git repository will no longer be the current one. The new repository and project pages are located on Gitorious - <a href="http://gitorious.org/bkchem">http://gitorious.org/bkchem</a> and <a href="http://gitorious.org/oasa">http://gitorious.org/oasa</a>.</p>
      <p>I wish you all a very nice summer and better and faster BKChem releases.</p>
      <p>Beda</p>

      <p>After a long time of silence, I decided to publish an older snapshot of BKChem, so that at
      least something new appears. In this release several bugs were fixed, German translation was
      updated and the Windows package now includes <a href="http://cairographics.org/">Cairo</a>
      thus enabling high quality PNG export.</p>

      <p>Because questions from users start to crop up if BKChem is still developed, I decided to
      update the website even without a new release.
      Unfortunately, I did not have much time lately to work on BKChem. Some progress has been made,
      but I have no time for the boring and time consuming work needed to make a reasonably good
      release. I am sorry for that, especially because there is a new German translation waiting
      to be included and several bugfixes. Shame on me.</p>
      <p>To do at least something for the users, I have updated the <a href="arch_en.html">development sources page</a>, because the howto was out of date and did
      not work, and also the Arch build scripts.</p>
      <p>I hope to make a release soon, but I can't promise anything.</p>

      export now asks for resolution of the exported file, thus enabling creation of high
