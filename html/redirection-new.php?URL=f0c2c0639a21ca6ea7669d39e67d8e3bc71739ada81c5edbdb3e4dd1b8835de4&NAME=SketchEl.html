<p><i>SketchEl</i> is an interactive chemical molecule sketching tool, and molecular spreadsheet data entry application. The feature set provided
by the molecular sketcher is largely limited to the minimum features required to conveniently edit diagram representations of small molecule
structures. Toolbars, templates, mouse gestures, keyboard shortcuts, utility commands and several view modes are offered in order to make this as
convenient as possible. Molecules can be easily interconverted with the ubiquitous MDL MOL file format, though not not necessarily without
information loss. Molecule diagrams are rendered interactively in high quality, and can also be exported as SVG graphics.

<p>The newer datasheet feature of <i>SketchEl</i> allows viewing and editing of simple tables of data, for which each column is a common scalar
type (string, int, real, boolean) or a molecule. Editing and viewing of molecules is linked to the molecule sketching tool. The datasheet editing
is intended to be convenient for entering numeric property and identification data, alongside the molecular structures of interest. The native
format is XML based, with features for interconverting with MDL SD files.

<p>All of the <i>SketchEl</i> features are written and compiled with Java 1.5, and make full use of the features available in the default
libraries. There are no additional dependencies. The code is most extensively tested on Linux platforms, frequently on Windows, and occasionally
on Mac OS X. The single-molecule editing feature can be run as a Java Applet within a web page, and the underlying molecule contents can be
manipulated by JavaScript programs.

<tr><th valign="top">Status</th>
<td>

<p>Feature-complete. Version 1.00 provided all of the baseline features for single-molecule sketching. Subsequent improvements include the
datasheet editor and SVG export, as well as regular bug fixes and minor improvements. Most recent files often contain experimental features which
may not have been tested extensively. Consult changelogs for more information.

<tr><th valign="top">Features</th>
<td>

<ul>

<p><li>Easy to use interactive tools for placing atoms and bonds. 

<p><li>Tools are multipurposed in order to provide convenient access to necessary drawing modes, and to operate with either fine-control or
generally reasonable assumptions.

<p><li>Automatic or manual control over creation, calculation and rendering of hydrogen atoms.

<p><li>Built-in structure templates.

<p><li>Aesthetically pleasant output, using anti-aliased rendering and arbitrary size scaling.

<p><li>Molecules can be exported as SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) pictures for external use.

<p><li>More recently, pictures can be exported as ODG (OpenDocument Graphics) pictures, which can be used within the OpenOffice
suite, among others.

</div>

<p><li>Reads and writes industry standard MDL MOL files, a flavour of CML XML, as well as its own format.

<p><li>Provides a datasheet editor, which allows tables of data with molecular structures to be edited alongside accompanying data.

<p><li>Datasheets use an XML format, and can be interconverted with MDL SD files.

<p><li>Platform independent and open source; uses Java 1.5, Swing with no further dependencies. All source code is copyrighted by
the author, and made available under the GPL v2.0.

<p><li>Applet mode can be used for embedding molecular sketching in a web page.

<tr><th valign="top">Documentation</th>

<p>No official user documentation exists at the present time, though the menu entries, toolbar icons and popup help should be
largely self-explanatory, given a modicum of experimentation. The most uptodate description of the molecule file format is
provided on the <a href="http://molmatinf.com/fmtsketchel.html" target="_blank">Molecular Materials Informatics</a> website.
