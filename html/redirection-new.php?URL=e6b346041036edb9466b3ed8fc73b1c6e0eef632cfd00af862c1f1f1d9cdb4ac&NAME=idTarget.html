<div class=contsub>
A web server for identifying biomolecular targets of small chemical
molecules with robust scoring functions and a divide-and-conquer docking
approach
</div>
<div class=contbody style="margin: 15px;">
Identification of biomolecular targets of small chemical molecules is essential for
unraveling their underlying causes of actions at the molecular level. Often, natural products, i.e.,
compounds discovered from plants, animals, marine lives or other living organism,
exhibit useful pharmaceutical effects, e.g., anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-
viral effects, yet their molecular mechanisms remain elusive. On the other hand,
many drugs are known to be accompanied with unpleasant adverse effects, but the
molecular targets of such effects are largely unknown. On the contrary, there are also some
old drugs whose beneficiary effects are discovered only recently, e.g., the anticancer effect
of cholesterol-lowering drugs, statins, whose molecular mechanisms have been 
an intensive research subject. 
idTarget is a web server that can predict possible binding targets of a small chemical molecule via a
<a href="http://idtarget.rcas.sinica.edu.tw/document.php#DA">divide-and-conquer docking approach</a>, 
in combination with our recently developed
scoring functions and affinity profile of the protein target, where the 
<a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci200220v">new robust scoring function</a> 
were trained based on robust regression analysis and quantum
chemical charge models. In the divide-and-conquer docking calculations, small
overlapping grids are adaptively constructed to constrain the searching space and
thereby achieving the convergence of docking results with better efficiency. idTarget
has been shown to be able to reproduce known off-targets of drugs or drug-like
compounds.
