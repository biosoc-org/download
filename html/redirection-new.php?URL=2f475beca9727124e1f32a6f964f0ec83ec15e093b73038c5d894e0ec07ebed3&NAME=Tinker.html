<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
The Tinker molecular modeling software is a complete and general
package for molecular mechanics and dynamics, with some special features
for biopolymers. Tinker has the ability to use any of several common
parameter sets, such as Amber (ff94, ff96, ff98, ff99, ff99SB), CHARMM
(19, 22, 22/CMAP), Allinger MM (MM2-1991 and MM3-2000), OPLS (OPLS-UA,
OPLS-AA), Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF), Liam Dang's polarizable
model, AMOEBA (2004, 2009, 2013, 2017, 2018) polarizable atomic multipole
force fields, AMOEBA+ that adds charge penetration effects, and our new
HIPPO (Hydrogen-like Interatomic Polarizable POtential) force field.
Parameter sets for other force field models are under consideration for
future releases.
</P></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
The Tinker software contains a variety of interesting algorithms
such as: flexible implementation of atomic multipole-based electrostatics
with explicit dipole polarizability, various continuum solvation treatments
including several generalized Born (GB/SA) models, generalized Kirkwood
implicit solvation for AMOEBA, an interface to APBS for Poisson-Boltzmann
calculations, efficient truncated Newton (TNCG) local optimization,
surface areas and volumes with derivatives, free energy calculations via
the Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) method, normal mode vibrational analysis,
minimization in Cartesian, torsional or rigid body space, symplectic RESPA
multiple time step integration for molecular dynamics, velocity Verlet
stochastic dynamics, pairwise neighbor lists and splined spherical energy
cutoff methods, particle mesh Ewald (PME) summation for partial charges and
polarizable multipoles, a novel reaction field treatment of long range
electrostatics, fast distance geometry metrization with better sampling
than standard methods, Elber's reaction path algorithm, potential
smoothing and search (PSS) methods for global optimization, Monte Carlo
Minimization (MCM) for efficient potential surface scanning, tools for
fitting charge, multipole and polarization models to QM-based electrostatic
potentials and more....

<H2>Current Release</H2>
</CENTER>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
Tinker 8 is a major new release of the Ponder Lab tool set for
molecular mechanics and dynamics calculations. An important change in
this new version is the switch from old-style common blocks to Fortran
modules. Use of modules and greatly increased use of dynamic memory
allocation means Tinker can now support very large molecular systems.
Tinker 8 also implements improved OpenMP parallelization throughout
many parts of the code. Additional major improvements include parallel
neighbor list building and updating, a big reduction in iterations
needed to converge polarization via an efficient PCG solver, and the
reparameterizaton of Poisson-Boltzmann and Generalized Kirkwood
implicit solvation models..
</P></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
Other changes from the previous Tinker version include new and updated
force field parameter sets and numerous minor additions and bug fixes,
many of them suggested by users of the package. Please note that as with
prior new releases, version 8 is neither backward nor forward compatible
with earlier versions of Tinker. In particular, older versions of parameter
files should not be used with Tinker 8 executables and vice versa.
</P></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
While we strongly suggest users switch to Tinker 8 with its many
important new features and bug fixes, we provide download links below
for prior stable versions, Tinker 7.1.3, Tinker 6.3.3, Tinker 5.1.9 and
Tinker 4.3. Tinker 6 and later releases are OpenMP parallel and written
in Fortran 95, while Tinker 4 and 5 are in serial, extended Fortran 77.
</P></UL>

<CENTER>
<H2>Availability</H2>
</CENTER>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
This distribution version of Tinker, with full source code, is licensed
free of charge to academic research groups, government laboratories, and
non-profit organizations. Use in commercial settings requires a commercial
license, as described in the Tinker License Agreement found below.
</P></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
Download links are provided in the bottom section of this web page. Major
new releases of the package with additional features are generally placed
on this site during February, June and October. Minor changes and bug fixes
are added to the distribution version as we finish testing them. The basic
package has been used by the Ponder lab and others at Washington
University for several years and should be fairly robust. All we ask
is that you notify us of any bugs, features you would like to see
implemented, or major code extensions that you add yourself.
</P></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1"> 
Non-commercial users who make significant use of the package should
complete and return by regular post or email the license form available
below. The forms are used to aid us in convincing colleagues Tinker is
used outside of Washington University, which helps us justify further
development of the programs. We try to respond to email as time allows.
Comments are always welcome and should be directed to Jay Ponder at
ponder@dasher.wustl.edu.
</P></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
Tinker is also available on Github! The TinkerTools organization has a full
Github site at <A HREF="https://github.com/TinkerTools">
https://github.com/TinkerTools</A> with complete source code
for canonical Tinker and other packages in the Tinker software suite. The
master repository on the Github site is updated frequently with new minor
features and bug fixes. It the place to go for the latest revisions of the
software. Prebuilt executables are not available via the Github site.
</P></UL>

<CENTER>
<H2>Installation</H2>
</CENTER>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
Tinker 8 is provided as a complete source distribution via the links below.
After unpacking the distribution, you can build a set of Tinker executables
on almost any machine with a Fortran compiler. Makefiles, a GNU autoconf
configure script, as well as standalone scripts to compile, build object
libraries, and link executables on a wide variety of machine-CPU-operating
system combinations are provided.
</P></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
If you wish to build the OpenMP-capable parallel version of Tinker, object
libraries from the FFTW 3.3 Fourier transform package are required. The FFTW
libraries must be available in the one of the locations searched by the
Tinker Makefile prior to building Tinker executables. Optional Support for
APBS Poisson-Boltzmann calculations within Tinker requires object libraries
from the APBS 1.3 software package.
</P></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
Pre-built Tinker executables for Linux, macOS, and Windows are also available
for download below. They should run on most recent vintage machines using
the above operating systems, and can handle a maximum of 1 million atoms
provided sufficient memory is available. The Linux executables require at
least glibc-2.6 or later. Note starting with Tinker 8, we no longer provide
pre-built executables for 32-bit operating systems.
</P></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
The provided executables are OpenMP capable, but do not support APBS
or the Tinker-FFE interface. You will still need to have a copy of the
complete Tinker distribution as it contains the parameter sets, examples,
benchmarks, test files and documentation required to use the package.
</P></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
Only a very few portions of Tinker still make use of static memory
allocation, however some of the executables can require a large memory
(<I>i.e.,</I> total of actual RAM and swap space/virtual memory) to handle
large molecular systems. There are instructions available on the internet for
increasing the size of the swap space/virtual memory under various versions
of Linux and Windows. If a program fails with the message "insufficient
virtual memory", "resource temporarily unavailable" or a "segmentation
fault", then you may need to add swap space. macOS increases the size
of the swap space automatically as needed, and such modifications are not
needed to use Tinker on a Macintosh.
</P></UL>

<CENTER>
<H2>Tinker9</H2>
</CENTER>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
Tinker9 is a new software package built on top of the current Tinker version,
and intended to provide high performance on single NVIDIA GPU-based systems.
The code is written in C++ with GPU extensions utilizing OpenACC and CUDA,
and it links against the Fortran Tinker library. Tinker9 is available from
the TinkerTools site on Github (https://github.com/TinkerTools/tinker9/) with
source code, documentation and instructions for building executables. At
present, Tinker9 supports traditional biomolecular force fields including
Amber, CHARMM and OPLS, as well as the AMOEBA, AMOEBA+ and HIPPO models
developed by the Ponder lab and our collaborators.
</P></UL>

<CENTER>
<H2>Tinker-OpenMM</H2>
</CENTER>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
OpenMM is a molecular modeling library developed at Stanford University.
It supports the AMOEBA force field, and supplies CUDA code implementing AMOEBA
on NVIDIA GPUs. On this site we provide code interfacing selected Tinker
programs with OpenMM. The source code and a Makefile needed to construct
OpenMM-enabled Tinker ANALYZE, BAR and DYNAMIC programs is available below
for download. The Makefile assumes OpenMM 7.1 or later is installed and a
CUDA-capable graphics card is present. Depending upon the size of the system
being simulated and the GPU card available, OpenMM-based Tinker molecular
dynamics is very significantly faster than the standard CPU-based version.
</P></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
To build Tinker-OpenMM executables, you must have an NVIDIA GPU installed
on your build system along with the CUDA development environment including
the "nvcc" CUDA compiler. Download and install the current OpenMM version
from Github. Then follow the instructions in the /openmm directory of the
full Tinker distribution, or use the equivalent Tinker interface code for
OpenMM for provided as a separate download below. Tinker-OpenMM executables
have been tested on Linux, and should also work under Windows. Due to the
regretable disfunction between Apple and NVIDIA, the last version of macOS
with available NVIDIA graphics drivers is 10.13.6 (High Sierra), the last
version of CUDA to work with macOS is CUDA 10.2, and only GPU cards through
the GeForce GTX 10 ("Pascal") series are supported.
</P></UL>

<H2>Tinker on Android Devices</H2>
</CENTER>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
Tinker is available on the Google Play Store for a variety of Android devices
via self-extracting installers implemented and maintained by Alan Liska and
Veronika Ruzickova of the J. Heyrovksy Institute of Physical Chemistry in
Prague. Binaries and documentation are also available from the Mobile
Chemistry Portal located at http://www.jh-inst.cas.cz/~liska/Tinker.htm/.

<CENTER>
<H2>Tinker-FFE ("Force Field Explorer")</H2>
</CENTER>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
Force Field Explorer (Tinker-FFE) is a Java-based GUI for the Tinker package.
It provides visualization for Tinker molecule files, as well as launching of
Tinker calculations from a graphical interface. The original version of FFE
was written by Michael Schnieders, now on the Biomedical Engineering faculty
at the University of Iowa, prior to and during his thesis work in St. Louis.
It was further revised by Jeff Bigg, Tyler Ponder and Brendan McMorrow during
summers spent in the Ponder lab. A major update for Tinker 8, renamed
Tinker-FFE, was completed in July 2017. Tinker-FFE for Linux, macOS and
Windows can be downloaded from the lower section of this web page as
"installation kits" containing the FFE GUI and an FFE-enabled version of
Tinker. Tinker-FFE requires a 64-bit CPU and operating system, as 32-bit
systems are no longer supported.
</P></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
Integration with Tinker, including the ability to interactively run Tinker
calculations, and to access molecule downloads from the PubChem, NCI and PDB
databases make Tinker-FFE a useful tool in classroom teaching environments.
For research work, we recommend using the latest command line version of
Tinker for numerical calculations, and using FFE or another visualization
program to view results. Several other visualization programs (including VMD,
Avogadro, Jmol, MOLDEN, WebMO, some PyMOL versions, <I>etc.</I>) can display
Tinker structure and MD trajectory files. 
</P></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
For those wishing to modify the FFE GUI or build a version from source,
we provide a complete development package for Tinker-FFE. This is a large
download which contains the code for all components, including the Java source
for FFE itself and the many required Java libraries. This package allows
building Tinker-FFE on all three supported operating systems from a common
code base. External requirements are the GNU compiler suite with gcc, g++ and
gfortran (on Windows use the MinGW-w64 GNU compilers under Cygwin), and the
Install4j Multi-Platform Java Installer Builder.
</P></UL>

<UL><H3><P>
Installation Notes for Tinker-FFE on Linux:
</P></H3></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
The Tinker-FFE Installer for Linux is provided as a gzipped shell script.
Uncompress the the .gz archive to produce an .sh script, and then run
the script. The script must have the "executable" attribute, set via
"chmod +x *.sh", prior to being run. If you have the installer generate a
desktop icon, you may need to make the icon "launchable". This is done on
Ubuntu by right clicking on the icon and selecting "Allow Launching".
</P></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
On some older Linux distributions, the Tinker-FFE Installer does not launch
correctly or hangs. For these systems, we provide an alternative Tinker-FFE
distribution as a gzipped tar archive. Download this Tinker-FFE archive,
ungzip the file and copy it to the end user's home directory, then extract
the distribution there via the "tar xvf" command. The application is located
in $HOME/Tinker-FFE/ffe/.
</P></UL>

<UL><H3><P>
Installation Notes for Tinker-FFE on macOS:
</P></H3></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
<B><I>Note: The current version of FFE may not run on macOS versions later
than High Sierra (10.13). We are looking into this problem.</I></B>
</P></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
The Tinker-FFE Installer for macOS is provided as a .dmg disk image file.
Double-click on the file to run the installer. Recent versions of macOS
contain a security feature called Gatekeeper that keeps applications not
obtained via the App Store or Apple-approved developers from being opened.
Gatekeeper is enabled by default, and may result in the (incorrect!) error
message: "Tinker-FFE Installer.app is damaged and can't be opened."
To turn off Gatekeeper, go to the panel System Preferences > Security &
Privacy > General, and set "Allow apps downloaded from:" to "Anywhere". This
will require an Administrator account, and must be done before invoking the
FFE installer. Once FFE is installed and launched for the first time, you
can return the System Preference to its prior value. On macOS 10.12 and
later, the "Anywhere" option has been removed. In most cases the Security
& Privacy panel will open and permit the user to run the installer. 
Alternatively, the "Anywhere" option can be restored by running the command
"sudo spctl --master-disable" in a Terminal window.
</P></UL>

<UL><H3><P>
Installation Notes for Tinker-FFE on Windows:
</P></H3></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
The Tinker-FFE Installer for Windows is provided as a zipped executable.
First, unzip the .zip file, then run the resulting executable .exe file.
In order to perform minimizations or molecular dynamics from within FFE,
some environment variables and symbolic links must be set prior to using
the program. A batch file named "FFESetupWin.bat" is installed in the
main Tinker-FFE directory, which by default resides in the user's home
directory. To complete the setup of FFE, this batch file should be run
from a Command Prompt window following installation. It is only necessary
to invoke this batch file once, as the settings should persist between
logins.
</P></UL>

<H2>Future Development</H2>
</CENTER>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
We have big plans for the Tinker package going forward. New program packages
in the Tinker family, Tinker 9 and Tinker-HP, are under active development.
Our future development will focus on free energy calculations, major new
sampling methods, enhanced crystal modeling capability, improved force field
parameterization methods, additions to the AMOEBA model, and new force fields,
including AMOEBA+ and HIPPO.
</P></UL>

<UL><P CLASS="FONT1">
Tinker 9 is a reimplementation of significant portions of Tinker in C++,
using OpenACC and CUDA to support NVIDIA GPU calculations. Tinker-HP is an
distributed, MPI-parallel Fortran code that is also GPU capable via use of
CUDA for compute intensive functions. Both of these Tinker-based codes are
available from the TinkerTools Github site. Suggestions and comments
regarding possible additions to Tinker or other codes in the Tinker family
are always welcome. Of course, offers to provide or help write code are even
better....
