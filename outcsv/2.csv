At the beginning, only information about the coordinates and elements for each atom is available: (i) Connectivity is recognized; (ii) A search of rings is performed to find the Smallest Set of Smallest Rings (SSSR); (iii)  Atomic hybridizations are predicted by the corresponding SVM model; (iv) Bond orders are predicted by the corresponding SVM model; (v) Aromatic cycles are found and (vi) Atomic types are set in obedience to the functional groups. Some bonds are reassigned during this stage. Linux and MacOS version are free of charge. Maintained by the Nano-D team, Inria/CNRS Grenoble, France."
