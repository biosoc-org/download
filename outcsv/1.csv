Subsequently, information from the extracted databases were unified to the same format and checked to ensure that all entries are only GPCR-related. Thus, the user would not find any entries on receptor tyrosine kinases or any other protein that is not a GPCR. All relevant ligand chemical data (PubChem) and GPCR data (UniProt) were extracted accordingly for each GPCR-ligand entry. Each molecule with a unique InChI key was considered a unique ligand entry in the database. Developed and maintained by the Zhang Lab at the University of Michigan, USA."
