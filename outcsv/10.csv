Entirely new approach to assess binding affinities and contributions to binding of a complex, with a visual feedback at atomic detail. Hyde shows  which regions of a complex contribute favorably and infavorably to the binding. Allows modifying a molecule interactively to optimize a complex and trigger new lead optimization ideas. Hyde is entirely based on physics-principles and has not been trained or calibrated on experimental data. Distributed by BioSolveIT."
