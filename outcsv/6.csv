Web service for blind molecular docking method on low-resolution protein structures. The method first identifies putative ligand binding sites by structurally matching the target to the template holo-structures. The ligand-protein docking conformation is then constructed by local shape and chemical feature complementarities between ligand and the negative image of binding pockets.

The portal contains the DOPIN (Docked Proteome Interaction Network) database constituted by millions of pre-docked and pre-scored complexes from thousands of targets from the human proteome and thousands of drug-like small molecules from the NCI diversity set and other sources. The portal is also a server that can be used to (i) customize scoring functions and apply them to rank molecules and targets in DOPIN; (ii) dock against pre-processed targets of the PDB; and (iii) search for off-targets. Maintained by the laboratory of Samy Meroueh at the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at the Indiana University School of Medicine.

Allows comparative docking of ligands into the ATP-binding site of a protein kinase (target). A sequence alignment of the target and a protein kinase profile is performed using HMMER. It uses protein-protein superposition (automatically restricted to the ligand binding pocket) of the target three-dimensional structure with those of known complexes of protein kinases/ligands.
