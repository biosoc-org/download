Free program to superimpose two rigid 3D molecular structure models, based on shape and electrostatic potentials, and computes a similarity index for the overlay. It can be used for the virtual screening of libraries of chemical structures against a known active molecule, or as a preparative step for 3D QSAR methods."

AutoClickChem can be used to produce large combinatorial libraries of compounds for use in virtual screens. As the compounds of these libraries are constructed according to the reactions of click chemistry, they can be easily synthesized for subsequent testing in biochemical assays. Exists as a stand alone program. Maintained by the National Biomedical Computation Resource."
