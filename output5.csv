TRAnsient Pockets in Proteins (TRAPP) is a web server for the analysis of transient binding pockets in proteins. Contrarily to many tools, it is not  intended for ligand binding pocket identification per se, but rather to predict significant changes in the spatial and physicochemical properties of a given pocket that may arise due to the protein's flexibility (both backbone and side chains). Several capabilities of visualization and analysis have been developed and are provided by the Molecular and Cellular Modeling group at Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies, Germany."
